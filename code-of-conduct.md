At Notbinary we are united by our desire to help our clients thrive in the digital economy, our love of learning and our focus on commercial success. But beyond those common threads we want to be inclusive to the largest number of people, partners and clients with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

**Reporting Guidelines**

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify either a trusted colleague or by using the following email address CodeofConduct@notbinary.co.uk.

Where investigations are necessary Notbinary will use an independent external expert to undertake the process. Anonymity will be respected on both sides of the allegation.
Scope

This Code of Conduct is in place primarily for our own staff and associates. However, if a Notbinary team member feels that a partner or client has behaved inappropriately towards them or a colleague we would ask that Notbinary is notified so that we can address this with the third party.

**Grievance Procedure**

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify CodeofConduct@notbinary.co.uk with a concise description of your grievance. Notbinary will attempt to mediate perceived unfair allegations. False allegations may be investigated, again using an external third party, and if found to be false Notbinary may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including, adherence to formal disciplinary procedures as outlined in employment and supplier contracts.
