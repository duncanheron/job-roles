There's no typical day for our Tech Leads. You might find yourself designing modern architectural approaches for clients while dealing with legacy software (and approaches) or maybe spending a few weeks with a client reviewing their technology and processes; identifying opportunities to introduce modern ways of working.

On other projects it could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery where you're happy coding and helping the team to deliver the solution.

You will certainly be assisting in helping us hire additional technologists - whether permanent staff or contractors and for those interested we support you taking on an evangelism role for the company and our approach to technology.  Promoting your ideas and building your network via whichever channels suit you best (blogging, hackdays, talks, open source contributions) . This isn’t a side hustle - we see it is a core part of the role and will support with time and resources appropriately.

**Knowledge and experience**

- Hands-on technology leadership
- Expertise and interest in more than one programming language (e.g. Java, .Net, Python, Ruby/Rails)
- Experience as an architect or leading and inspiring software development teams
- Good understanding of building and working with legacy and ‘brownfield’ systems
- Good understanding of cloud infrastructure toolset (AWS/ GCP/Azure etc)
- Experience of agile working rather than specific Agile™ frameworks
- Strong understanding and experience of the theory and application of Continuous Integration/Delivery
- A passion for software craft
- Experience working across different organisations, ranging in size, from start-ups to big bureaucracies
- Good communication skills - able to articulate technical information to different backgrounds

**Code of conduct**

All Notbinary staff (including contractors and freelancers) agree to accept our ‘[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/notbinary/job-roles/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)’. This sets out unacceptable behaviours and the process to flag anything that strays from those principles. It is an evolving document and we welcome comment from team members on how we can improve it and our approach to creating a welcoming, diverse culture.

**Hiring process**

Interviews will consist of an initial conversation with one of the Partners to get an idea of your working history and approach. If successful then there will be a more technical interview with the lead specialist. We don’t do riddles or whiteboards - we ask straight questions and are looking for evidence of potential as much as experience. Interviews can be in person or via the video chat client of your preference - candidates choice.

Assuming it all goes well we will make an offer.  We will also arrange an opportunity to meet other members of the team ahead of your start date. We’ll cover any expenses and give you a couple of extra days leave if you take us up on the offer.

**Ways of working**

Notbinary are not based in an office; our staff are primarily based on site with clients or work from home but we do have hubs based in Cardiff and London where you can work alongside colleagues when the opportunity arises.

We embrace a ‘small teams, loosely joined’ philosophy - teams on client sites develop their own culture and approaches.

Notbinary pays for the equipment you need, including your work laptop, desk rental in a co-working office or anything else that’s essential to getting stuff done.

The team meets up in person every two months - a chance to share plans, scheme new ideas and catch up with colleagues.


**Apply**

Email jobs@notbinary.co.uk with a CV (or a link to LinkedIn if you prefer) and a few words about what appeals to you about this role. We'll take it from there.

**This is important —>**

Travel is required. Projects are usually at client offices, so our staff need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Most of our people travel every week and travel home for weekends. We do our best to take people’s personal situations into account, but we know it’s not for everyone.

We describe our work pattern as the ‘3-4-5 rule’ --> 

- 3 nights in an hotel
- 4 days in a client office
- 5 days billed

We follow this pattern as much as possible so our staff can maintain a sensible work-life balance. However, the needs of our clients take priority so make sure you're comfortable with this before applying.
